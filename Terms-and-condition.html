            </ol>
            </p>
            <h4>2.2 PRODUCTS</h4>
            <p>We have different types of products. This may include products fully designed and created by us
                (“Standards Products”) – and products that, although designed by us, may be personalised by you by
                adding your own content: you can for example add your name, select a player or number (“Personalised
                Products”), jointly “Products”.

                Please note that in the case of limited edition or limited production Products extra restrictions such
                as limiting the number of such Products per consumer may apply. These extra restrictions will be made
                known to you via the Platform.

                All Products shown on the Platform are subject to availability. This means that, although we strive to
                ensure our Platform reflects the availability of stock, a Product shown on the Platform may no longer be
                available for purchase.

                Minor differences in colour and other variations in Products are possible as a result of different image
                acquisition, display technologies or other technical reasons. StepIN is not liable for these variations
                and deviations. No rights can be derived from typing errors, product descriptions or manifest errors on
                the Platform.</p>

            <p>The following applies to all types of Products. All information on the Platform is an invitation to treat

                is deemed to have been refused. </p> 
            <p>We may choose not to accept your order at our own discretion. Examples of when we may not accept your
                order are as follows:
